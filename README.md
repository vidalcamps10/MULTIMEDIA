My curriculum is aimed at the profile of computer companies, which are dedicated to programming, web page management, database control and other aspects related to computer science. My choice to focus on this profile is based on my deep interest and passion for the computer world. I believe that computing is a constantly evolving field that presents exciting challenges and opportunities for innovation.

To design my CV I have been inspired by different CVs that I have found on the internet, from the beginning I have had clear that the design was going to be, separate the page into two sections, the left part with a white background where I was going to place my image and the sections with less information or more focused on personal information, always separated by horizontal lines of black colour, just below the image I have placed the most personal information such as telephone, mail, address ..... As for the right side, I have opted for a light brown colour, as the image I have placed has a very similar background colour, which creates a good visual aesthetic. In this part I have placed my full name at the top of the page and with a large size so that it stands out above all, as for the sections I have placed the most extensive and that have more information and are more focused on the trajectory as a worker and student.
